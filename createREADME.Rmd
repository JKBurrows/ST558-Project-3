# Introduction 

The purpose of this project is to create a Shiny app to explore data about Star Wars fans. I used data that has been made available [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey) by FiveThrityEight. 

I made use of the following packages: *shiny*, *shinydashboard*, *tidyverse*, *DT*, *dendextend*, *caret*, *gbm*, *formula.tools*, *cluster*, *devtools*, *rmarkdown*, and *plotly*. 

# Run App

To run the app, run the following code in R on your computer: 

```{r Run App, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("shiny", "shinydashboard", "tidyverse", "DT", "dendextend", "caret", "gbm", "formula.tools", "cluster", "devtools", "rmarkdown", "plotly"))
